KEYWORDS "Kick counter and contraction timer are practical and useful
Symptom reassurance addresses real anxiety
Week-by-week tracking is essential
What's Missing (Emotional Gaps):

Partner Sharing - Pregnancy is a shared journey. Letting my partner see baby's development, get reminders for my appointments, and feel involved would be huge.
Bump Photo Journal - Moms LOVE documenting the journey. Weekly bump photos with baby size overlays to create a visual memory book.
Community Connection - First-time moms feel isolated. A safe space to connect with moms at similar weeks, ask questions, share experiences.
Doctor Appointment Tracker - Notes for questions to ask, record answers, store ultrasound images, track test results.
Hospital Bag Checklist - Practical and highly searched in 3rd trimester.
Birth Plan Builder - Guided questions to create and share birth preferences with hospital.
Baby Names - Fun feature moms spend hours on. Save favorites, see meanings, share with partner.
Weight Tracker - Track healthy weight gain with personalized guidance.
Guided Meditations/Affirmations - Audio content for anxiety, sleep, and birth preparation.
Postpartum Prep - What to expect after birth, recovery tips, breastfeeding basics.
The Core Issue: The current app is functional but not emotional. Pregnancy is deeply emotional - moms want to feel supported, capture memories, and connect with others.

Would you like me to add some of these high-impact features? I'd suggest starting with:

Bump Photo Journal (memory capture)
Partner Sharing (connection)
Hospital Bag & Birth Plan (practical value)


| Plan                       |     Price | Target          |

AIM
Good. Programmatic SEO (pSEO) is the right move for a pregnancy tracking app — if you do it properly. Done badly, you’ll get thin-content penalties. I’ll show you how to do this clean, scalable, and Google-safe.

No hype. This is execution.

🎯 Goal

Generate 450–600 indexable pages that:

Rank for long-tail pregnancy searches

Funnel users into BabyBloom installs

Avoid duplicate / thin content penalties

1️⃣ Choose ONE Core pSEO Template (Don’t Mix)

You don’t need 5 templates. You need 1–2 strong ones.

✅ Best pSEO Template for BabyBloom

“Pregnancy Week + Symptom + Context”

Example:

/pregnancy/12-weeks-pregnant-nausea

/pregnancy/20-weeks-pregnant-back-pain

/pregnancy/32-weeks-pregnant-checklist

This is real search demand, not junk.

2️⃣ Page Math (How You Reach 450–600 Pages)
Option A (Clean & Safe)

40 pregnancy weeks

× 10–12 symptoms each
= 400–480 pages

Add:

40 “weekly overview” pages

50 calculator / checklist pages

👉 Total: ~500–570 pages

3️⃣ Symptom List (Use These — They’re Proven)

Use only common, real symptoms:

nausea

vomiting

fatigue

headaches

cramps

back pain

bloating

dizziness

breast tenderness

mood swings

insomnia

frequent urination

Do NOT invent symptoms. Google will punish you.

4️⃣ Page Template (THIS MATTERS)

Every page must be semi-unique. No lazy copy-paste.

🔹 Template Structure
H1: 12 Weeks Pregnant with Nausea – What’s Normal?

Intro (dynamic): 
- Week number
- Symptom severity
- Reassurance tone

H2: Is nausea normal at 12 weeks?
(dynamic paragraph)

H2: Why it happens this week
(dynamic biology explanation)

H2: What helps (safe tips)
(dynamic list)

H2: When to call a doctor
(static but important)

H2: Track symptoms with BabyBloom
(soft CTA)


You must vary wording by week:

hormone levels

trimester context

baby size comparison

5️⃣ Data You Need (Before Coding)

Create structured data tables:

Pregnancy Weeks Table

week_number

trimester

baby_size (fruit analogy)

hormone_focus

Symptoms Table

symptom_name

severity_by_week

common_or_rare

safe_remedies

This lets you generate legit unique content programmatically.

6️⃣ Tech Stack (Simple, No Overengineering)

Since you already use modern JS:

Next.js (SSG)

MDX or JSON → page generator

Static generation (getStaticPaths)

Auto internal linking

DO NOT use client-side rendering for pSEO.

7️⃣ URL STRUCTURE (Critical)

Clean, human, keyword-rich:

/pregnancy/{week}-weeks-pregnant-{symptom}
/pregnancy/{week}-weeks-pregnant/
/pregnancy-due-date-calculator/


No parameters. No nonsense.

8️⃣ Indexing & Crawl Control

Generate XML sitemap (split if needed)

Use index,follow

Add canonical URLs

Block tag pages if auto-generated

Submit sitemap in Google Search Console.

9️⃣ Content Quality Guardrails (Don’t Skip)

Each page must have:

600–900 words

At least 2 dynamic sections

Unique title & meta description

Internal links to:

week overview

symptom hub

BabyBloom landing page

Thin pages = dead site.

10️⃣ Legal & Medical Protection (Very Important)

Add on every page:

“This content is for educational purposes only and not a substitute for medical advice.”

This isn’t optional.


DATABASE / DATA SCHEMA (MINIMAL, SCALABLE, SAFE)

You do NOT need a complex DB. You need structured truth.

You’ll have 3 core datasets.

A. pregnancy_weeks (40 rows)

This is your backbone.

{
  "week": 12,
  "trimester": "First",
  "baby_size": "lime",
  "baby_size_cm": "5.4 cm",
  "baby_weight": "14 g",
  "key_development": "Facial features becoming more defined",
  "hormone_focus": "hCG stabilizing, estrogen rising",
  "common_changes": [
    "reduced nausea",
    "more energy",
    "uterus expanding"
  ]
}


Why this matters

Lets content change by week

Prevents copy-paste garbage

Google sees real variation

B. pregnancy_symptoms (10–15 rows only)

Keep it real, not exhaustive.

{
  "symptom": "nausea",
  "medical_name": "morning sickness",
  "description": "A feeling of sickness or vomiting caused by hormonal changes",
  "safe_remedies": [
    "small frequent meals",
    "ginger tea",
    "hydration",
    "rest"
  ],
  "warning_signs": [
    "severe dehydration",
    "persistent vomiting",
    "weight loss"
  ]
}

C. symptom_week_map (THIS IS THE MAGIC)

This avoids thin pages.

{
  "week": 12,
  "symptom": "nausea",
  "severity": "moderate",
  "is_common": true,
  "week_context": "Symptoms may begin easing as the first trimester ends"
}


This table lets you:

Say why this symptom matters THIS week

Vary tone and urgency

Generate legit unique paragraphs

Folder Structure (Simple)
/data
 ├── pregnancyWeeks.json
 ├── symptoms.json
 └── symptomWeekMap.json


That’s enough to generate 500+ pages cleanly.

2️⃣ PRODUCTION-READY pSEO PAGE TEMPLATE

This is for:
/pregnancy/{week}-weeks-pregnant-{symptom}

Example:

/pregnancy/12-weeks-pregnant-nausea

🔹 TITLE (Dynamic)
12 Weeks Pregnant With Nausea – Is This Normal?

🔹 META DESCRIPTION
Experiencing nausea at 12 weeks pregnant? Learn why it happens, what helps, and when to talk to a doctor.

🔹 PAGE BODY TEMPLATE
H1

12 Weeks Pregnant With Nausea – What You Should Know

Intro (Dynamic)

At 12 weeks pregnant, many women experience nausea as hormone levels shift and your baby — now about the size of a lime — continues rapid development. While this symptom is common, its intensity can vary from person to person.

H2: Is nausea normal at 12 weeks?

Yes. Nausea is common at 12 weeks, especially as the body adjusts to changing levels of hCG and estrogen. For some, symptoms begin easing around this stage; for others, they may persist a little longer.

H2: Why nausea happens this week

During week 12, your body is transitioning out of the first trimester. Hormonal stabilization, changes in digestion, and increased blood volume can all contribute to lingering nausea.

H2: What can help ease nausea

Safe, commonly recommended options include:

Eating small, frequent meals

Staying hydrated

Ginger or lemon-based drinks

Avoiding strong smells

Getting adequate rest

H2: When to call a doctor

Contact a healthcare professional if nausea is accompanied by:

Persistent vomiting

Signs of dehydration

Weight loss

These may indicate hyperemesis gravidarum.

H2: Track symptoms with BabyBloom

Tracking nausea patterns can help you understand what triggers symptoms and when they improve. BabyBloom lets you monitor symptoms week by week and stay informed throughout your pregnancy.

👉 Track your pregnancy with BabyBloom.
